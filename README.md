Unity Project Version 2021.2.16
{Phase 1 cont.…}

*UnityEngine.AI  Nav Mesh*
	Render/Generate World via Gaia ML world toolkit after importing the package (if the environment does not include it.  (ipfs://QmQcE7KR33zBxXH1yM7SV8Pd4JGBFEc3ERzJLhJdNV2MEV) >GaiaML)
	Bake Environment after the state machine targets have been created inside the interactable smart objects game object/ Target Variables and increase the number of targets & destinations for agents to reach.
	Phase 1 completion will allow Crow-ML to interact with the environment without the need for user input *3rd person controller*

{Phase2}

	Gaia ML has various targets for training Crow-Agent i.e., going across a hill, traveling bumpy terrain, going upstairs, and various massive training environments for learning different locations.
.
	Agent can have different Actions while traveling to different states. ‘Jumping more than normal for training in the environment.

	Speed will increase drastically while training with a noticeable difference from Phase 1.

	Trains Crow-Agent to output an ONNX model to use in various avatars.

	updates ONNX model *especially when more information / Target destinations appear*

	Crow-Agent will be the Official Agent to train the network for various targets rendered in Gaia-ML Procedural Worlds environments via interactable smart objects scripts.
	walking, jumping, and sprinting is more sporadic... needs to be more human-like in action. Not jumping at a rave lol,. But this is a positive sign for the agent interacting with its neural network in the environment, so I am happy.
o	Configuration: Crow Agent Parameters
o	Crow-Agent ONNX
o	Timers: AI training status
o	Rewards: Agent Rewards *this model is public for no results from rewards*
o	Proof of Train: Checkpoints from Agent->Environment interactions

	ToDo: Add  animations for smart object interactions/ OpenAI Chat
